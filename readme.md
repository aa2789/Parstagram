## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

## Notes

After a few attempts of successfuly being able to take pictures, there was an error with the camera, and I wasn't able to connect to it for some reason. However, I did record
a gif of the camera working before it started crashing. The user signup/login/logout/persistance and the ability to take a picture and post are demonstrated in different gifs as a result.
